# SecureTest Access and Troubleshooting Guide

Here‚Äôs a refined and expanded troubleshooting guide with a new name for the testing tool. I'll rename "QuestionMark (QM)" to "SecureTest" throughout and improve clarity and structure.
SecureTest Troubleshooting Guide

For Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and/or Proctors
SecureTest Access

To access SecureTest, students/recruits should:

    Connect to a blue line (if available) or RTC-Students Wi-Fi.
    Ensure issued laptops are fully charged before the exam.
    Ensure SecureTest software is up to date.
        Students/recruits should check the Software Center (pinned to the taskbar) to see if any updates are pending.
    Ensure their issued phones are fully charged in case they need to tether to mobile data.
    Verify internet connectivity:
        Open a web browser and navigate to an external site (e.g., Google or Amazon).
        Once successful, close all opened tabs and windows.
    Access SecureTest:
        Open a browser and navigate to SecureTest via the saved bookmark or enter the URL:
        https://usgov.securetest.com/home/200167/
    Login Process:
        Some students may be redirected to the SecureTest Access Page. If so, they must log in and wait for further instructions.
        Others may go directly to SecureTest's Main Page. They should wait for further instructions.

Exam Availability:

    Students should see their exam listed under ‚ÄúMy Assessments.‚Äù
    If an exam is missing, contact the SecureTest team immediately.

Basic Troubleshooting in SecureTest
If a student cannot access SecureTest:

    Have them close and reopen their browser.
    Ensure they are connected to the correct Wi-Fi network (RTC-Students).

If a student is kicked out of their exam:

    Check for an open SecureTest window:
        Hold down Alt and press Tab to cycle through open windows.
        OR select Task View on the taskbar to view all open windows.
    If their exam window is still open, select it and continue.
    If SecureTest unexpectedly closes:
        Re-enter SecureTest via the link.
        The exam should be available under "My Assessments" with an option to resume.
        If the exam does not appear, inform a SecureTest team member.
    If SecureTest closes before the student can submit the exam or if they cannot select ‚ÄúSubmit,‚Äù notify a SecureTest team member immediately.

SecureTest VPN Troubleshooting (Wi-Fi Users)
If a student cannot connect to RTC-Students Wi-Fi:

    Have them check their VPN status in Zscaler.
        Click the caret icon on the taskbar (bottom-right).
        Click the Zscaler icon to open the application.
    Ensure the following:
        VPN ‚Äì Service Status should be ‚ÄúOn.‚Äù
        Authentication Status should be ‚ÄúAuthenticated.‚Äù
        If either status is incorrect, use the Turn On/Off or Authenticate Early function to reset.
    If the issue persists, the student should contact IT (see below).

Additional Troubleshooting Steps:

    If the VPN is connected, but SecureTest remains inaccessible, disconnect and reconnect the VPN.
    If they still cannot connect to the VPN:
        Close Zscaler.
        Disconnect from RTC-Students.
        Reconnect to RTC-Students.
        Try to re-authenticate.
        Restart the computer if necessary.

If SecureTest disconnects due to VPN/Wi-Fi loss during the exam:

    If prompted with a message about lost connectivity, have them select ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù
    Have them verify their VPN connection.
    If VPN shows as disconnected, follow the above steps to reconnect.
    If issues persist:
        If available, connect to a blue line (most classrooms have 1-2 access points).
        Close and reopen the browser, then access SecureTest again.
        If no blue line is available, have the student use a spare laptop, switch users (CTRL + ALT + DEL), insert their PIV card, and log in as usual.
    If SecureTest still does not function, contact RTC IT.
